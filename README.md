Introduction	
Over the past week, I undertook the development of a new personal portfolio website aimed at effectively showcasing my technical skills, professional experiences, and personal attributes. A significant highlight of this project is the custom-designed Soft Skills Scroll Bar—a feature that, while appearing simple, required nearly two hours of meticulous CSS refinement to achieve seamless animation and responsiveness. This document outlines the key components of the website, the rationale behind each design decision, and the insights gained throughout the process.
1. Navigation & Branding
To establish a personal and approachable brand identity, I designed a professional "A Paul" logo. The navigation menu was constructed using CSS Flexbox, ensuring even spacing and vertical alignment across various devices. For smaller screens, a hamburger toggle was introduced, allowing the menu to slide into view gracefully, thereby enhancing mobile usability without compromising aesthetics.
2. Home Section Layout
The hero section is organized into a two-column grid layout. The left column features a clear headline, subtitle, and a concise overview, while the right column displays my profile image which isdirectly linked to my LinkedIn profile for seamless access to my professional background. This balanced arrangement naturally draws attention to both my name and photograph. The primary call-to-action ("Get in Touch") and the secondary button ("View Work Experience") are distinctly styled to guide users toward the most pertinent next steps.
3. Skills Section
To create a more engaging presentation of my skills, vibrant, icon-driven cards for each technical category were made, including Statistical Data Analysis, Finance, and Web Development. The most notable innovation is the Soft Skills Scroll Bar:
•	Interactive Scrolling Container: A horizontally scrolling marquee showcases six core soft skills—Communication, Teamwork, Adaptability, Problem Solving, Time Management, and Emotional Intelligence.
•	Custom Scrollbar Styling: Utilizing CSS pseudo-elements, the scrollbar's thumb and track were styled to align with the site's color palette, ensuring visual consistency.
•	Responsive Behavior: The scroll bar adjusts its width and animation timing across devices, maintaining legibility and smooth interaction from mobile to desktop platforms.
Achieving seamless looping and precise timing for the animation demanded extensive experimentation with @keyframes percentages, easing functions, and container overflow settings. This process, though time-consuming, significantly enhanced my understanding of CSS animations and responsive design principles.
4. Work Experience Timeline
To present a coherent narrative of my professional growth, the timeline places current pursuits—such as preparing for CFA Level I and MBA entrance exams—at the forefront. Each role includes concise, metric-driven bullet points, highlighting achievements like driving ₹20,000 in monthly sales as a Social Media Manager and earning "Employee of the Month" honors six consecutive times as a Sales Executive. This quantitative emphasis strengthens my credibility and allows recruiters to quickly assess my impact.
5. Education & Courses
My educational journey is depicted through a clean vertical timeline, detailing my current BBA studies at IIM Bangalore, followed by academic milestones at DPS Gurgaon. Complementing this, the Courses section is designed as a grid of branded cards, featuring icons from institutions like Harvard, Yale, and Tally. Each card lists the full course title and provider, underscoring the prestige and rigor of the credentials earned.
6. Hobbies & Contact
To provide a holistic view of my persona, I added icon-enhanced cards for hobbies such as Music, Reading, and Sports. The Contact section is structured into two columns: one displaying my email, phone number, and LinkedIn link; the other hosting a simple, accessible form with HTML5 validation. This layout encourages both passive and active engagement, allowing visitors to either note my contact details or reach out directly through the form.
Reflections & Learnings
•	Advanced CSS Proficiency: Developing the Soft Skills Scroll Bar deepened my understanding of CSS pseudo-elements, overflow behaviors, and the intricacies of @keyframes animations.
•	Responsive Design Mindset: I gained insights into how minor adjustments in breakpoints and container widths can significantly impact mobile usability, reinforcing the importance of testing across devices.
•	Soft Skill Application: Beyond technical skills, this project honed my patience, perseverance, and problem-solving abilities, particularly when addressing cross-browser inconsistencies and refining visual details.
These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skill set but also prepared me for future collaborative projects that demand attention to detail and adaptability.
Conclusion
The newly developed portfolio aligns with modern design principles, offering richer interactivity and a clearer communication of both my technical and interpersonal strengths. The dedicated effort invested in perfecting the Soft Skills Scroll Bar exemplifies my commitment to quality and continuous improvement. I am eager to apply these lessons in future roles where clarity of presentation and meticulous attention to detail are paramount.
